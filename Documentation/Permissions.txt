Permissions need to be set to these in eclipse in order for them to
work on the Blue Host PHP Server

Folders: 755
Files: 644


How:
For Mac:
	-Click Eclipse->Preferences
	-Search FTP
	-Change the settings accordingly:
	
	4 = Read
	5 = Read/Execute
	6 = Read/Write
	7 = Read/Write/Execute
	
	The First number is Owner, Second is Group, Third is Other
	So, for example: 755 mean 7 for owner, 5 for group, 5 for other
